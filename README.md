## ✨ Project Summary  

I wanted to see which programming languages, frameworks, and technologies developers have been asking about the most — and how those trends have shifted over time.  

### Key Goals:
- 📌 Find the most used tags on Stack Overflow from **2022 to 2025**
- 📈 Analyze which technologies have gained or lost popularity
- 🌟 Spot new tools and frameworks rising among developers

---

## 🛠️ How I Did It  

- Collected tags and timestamps from Stack Overflow questions  
- Grouped the data by month to get a clear timeline of trends  
- Visualized everything with bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines

## 🔍 What I Learned  

- **Python** and **JavaScript** remain the most popular tags overall  
- Languages like **Java** and **C++** have seen a gradual decline  
- Frameworks like **TypeScript**, **ReactJS**, and **Flutter** are gaining attention  
- Overall Stack Overflow engagement seems to be dropping — could be due to changing platforms or community behavior
